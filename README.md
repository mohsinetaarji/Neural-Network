# Neural-Network
Digits dataset

For this assignment, you are asked to implement a neural
network for classifying the digits dataset from Scikit-Learn. The
implementation will be done in two different ways: First, you will use the
Scikit-Learn library to classify the data, then you will use your own Python
implementation of neural networks, based on the class notes, to classify the
same data a second time.


## For the Python implementation of a neural network, use an appropriate number of nodes in the hidden layer. Your output should include:



1) A plot for sample of twenty values of the cost,
spread evenly over the total number of iterations. 



2) The Confusion Matrix and Classification Report for the test data.



3) The impact of using different activation
functions on the accuracy and speed of the algorithm. for Layer 2 of the
network, you can use the sigmoid function. For Layer 1 of the network, apply
the sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and leaky ReLU. Please show a summary of your results
in the form of a table and provide your interpretation of the results
obtained.  



4) A comparison in the use of different number of
nodes in the hidden layer. Explain the results obtained.



## For the Scikit-Learn implementation, your output should show:



1) The Confusion Matrix and Classification report
for the test data.



2) A comparison of the results obtained in the
Python implementation.
