Digits dataset

For this assignment, you are asked to implement a neural
network for classifying the digits dataset from Scikit-Learn. The
implementation will be done in two different ways: First, you will use the
Scikit-Learn library to classify the data, then you will use your own Python
implementation of neural networks, based on the class notes, to classify the
same data a second time.


## For the Python implementation of a neural network, use an appropriate number of nodes in the hidden layer. Your output should include:

* A plot for sample of twenty values of the cost,
spread evenly over the total number of iterations. 

* The Confusion Matrix and Classification Report for the test data.

* The impact of using different activation
functions on the accuracy and speed of the algorithm. for Layer 2 of the
network, you can use the sigmoid function. For Layer 1 of the network, apply
the sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and leaky ReLU. Please show a summary of your results
in the form of a table and provide your interpretation of the results
obtained.  

* A comparison in the use of different number of
nodes in the hidden layer. Explain the results obtained.



## For the Scikit-Learn implementation, your output should show:

* The Confusion Matrix and Classification report
for the test data.

* A comparison of the results obtained in the
Python implementation.
